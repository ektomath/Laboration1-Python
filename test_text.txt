It is not possible to sort a dictionary, only to get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted.
Dictionaries are inherently orderless, but other types, such as lists and tuples, are not.
So you need an ordered data type to represent sorted values, which will be a listâ€”probably a list of tuples.
